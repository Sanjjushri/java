Types in java 
1. Primitive ==> for storing simple values 
2. Reference ==> for storing complex objects

Primitive Types:

Type----Bytes----Range 
bye       1      [-128, 127]
short     2      [-32k,32k]
int       4      [-2B, 2B] //B - billion
long      8      [large num]
float     4      
double    8
char      2      A,B,C, ... // ingle variables
boolean   1      true/false

for reference type we need to declare new operator to alloate memory for this variable
