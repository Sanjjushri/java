Benefits of Java:

1. Object Oriented - All the code is defined in classes and most of those classes can instantiated into object 
    eg: animal is a class 
        cat is an object 
        classes - are frame 
        object is a real picture 

2. Funcational Programming - java allows functional programming within the class 
    store a function in a variable 

3. Encapsulation: local, private, defaut, protected, public, exports, package 

4. Platform Independent: write once run anywhere 
 
5. Robust - prevent memory leaks by automatic garbage collection 

6. Simple 

7. Secure 

8. Multithreading - allow multiple piece of code to run at same time 

9. Backward Compatibility 

Every Java program:

Class - describe characteristics 

Object / Instance - Runtime instance of class in memory 
                  - It represent state of program 

Reference - Variable that points object 

    Animal      Dog     =   new Animal(); (Constructor)
    Class name  Oject Reference  Object
